			<p>The weekly letter is weekly, and very letter. I Write and podcast lessons, interviews, and conversations for beginners. I am personally a perpetual beginner and am unabashedly curious.</p>

			<p>Sometimes we record a show about Movies, or games, or something astonishing and surprising. There will be Interviews, Reviews, and Rants. Lots of writing and lots of coding. Mostly stuff that is surprising. Oh!, And this stuff too:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Tutorials and Posts about programming basics.</li>
				<li>Radio Interviews with talented beginners.</li>
				<li>New Books and guides for learning cool stuff.</li>
				<li>App Launches.</li>
				<li>Free Stuff.</li>
				<li>Stickers.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Enjoy the weekly letter.</p>
