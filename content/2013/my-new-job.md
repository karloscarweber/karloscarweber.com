I've been working for [media rain](http://mediarain.com) for over a month. It's awesome. A really great place to work. It's also a different experience than what I'm used to. Here are a few things that make it a better place to work than my last job. 

## Github

I never understood how important version control is until I began to use it everyday in a professional setting. Github lets you view exactly what was changed in each commit. Delete unused code and be confident that you can get it back if you need to. It has changed my workflow fundamentally and I never want to start a project without it. Github also acts as a kind of safety net for big and silly mistakes. A safety net that was utterly absent at my previous position. So many problems can be avoided simply by keeping everything on Github and commiting regularly.

## Remote Work.

If I don't want to come in today, barring important meetings, I don't have to. I can work from home at my discretion and focus on getting things done on time, even if my schedule is a little hectic currently. I actually get more work 

## We track our time.
