Even with the swift change of focus towards mobile apps and experiences, I'm still in love with the desktop web. Apps feel trendy, or at least they did about 4 years ago when I saw an Android phone for the first time. The first app I ever saw was a skymap that you could use to see the stars in any direction. It was an experience of wonder. I was amazed. But there is still something about a mysterious landing page that sparks my curiosity far more. Some unseen secret waiting to be revealed to the world behind the login screen. 


It's Awesome! one of my favorite things to do is to build out a site in HTML and CSS. Typesetting content is entertaining to me.
