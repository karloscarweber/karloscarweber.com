<p class="newlead">Let's be honest,<br> I overspent.</p>
<p class="newlead">Help me pay off some bills and I can take my family to Disneyland.</p>

I'm ironically writing a book about how to fail because I need some money. One of those situations happened where I had to come up with a bunch of dough real quick otherwise We would live at my Father in Law's house for months. It's me, my wife, and little Niko. So we got an exorbitant loan at a high interest rate.

<p>This is me trying to figure out what to do.</p>

I'm trying to earn $5,000 Dollars by Christmas so that I can Kill my bills and Go to Disneyland with my family. All it takes is 5 Big ones. <strong>5 G's</strong>. 

Committing Financial suicide due to circumstances outside my control has unfortunate side effects. Stress, Depression, and the worst fate of all, telling my wife that we can't go on vacation because I spent all the money for the next year on rent. So we went on a micro vacation!

My wife and I took the petty cash lying around the house and Drove to San Francisco to see the ocean. Monse had never seen the Ocean! Holy Crap!

Monse has **NEVER** been to Disneyland, can you believe that? I can hardly believe it. She deserves a vacation to Southern California. We'll be going with her sisters who have also never visited Disneyland.

<p class="newlead">What if this Doesn't work?<br> I have a backup plan.</p>

Ever Since Sam Soffes released Cheddar, I've been an avid fan and user. In fact I've made over 1500 tasks and 100 lists in the To Do app So far. But sometimes I just don't have access to a good internet connection. So I've been working on a little app Called Grasa.

Grasa is a Cheddar client with offline support, and sharing. When you're away from civilization, you can still make lists in offline mode. when you connect to wifi again your tasks will sync up.

But that's not all! NOPE! I often share my lists with my wife to make plans. Sometimes she want's me to remember a really big list of groceries that I almost always forget. Now She can make the list on her phone and share it with me instantly. If She needs to update the list while I'm away, She can add another item and I'll be sent a push notification with the change.

And it's all synced up of course.
