<h2 style="text-align:left;border-bottom:3px solid #7ebdfc;padding-left:5px;">About Me</h2>

I love Programming. Since I was a little kid Computers have fascinated me. I've wanted to Design &amp; Develop computer systems. Tron was cool, Star Trek was cool, and Computers were cool.

So in my teenage years I picked up a little book title: PHP in a Nutshell, I read this book like a novel and with my first credit card (Ironically called the college card), I bought the parts and built my first computer. Ever since then I have learned on my own everything from Database normalization to Responsive web development with media queries.
