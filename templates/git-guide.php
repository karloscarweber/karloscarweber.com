            <p>This is my very first post with textpress. I must say, It's a very impressive little blog engine. I have aspirations of writing my own blog engine, and I believe that I will. I don't see any harm in learning exactly how textpress works though. Today I spent a good 2 hours looking through the code and learning how this thing works. I hope to spend many more hours doing so.</p>
