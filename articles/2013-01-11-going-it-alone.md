So I lost my job a week before Christmas. Well, actually I was fired hardcore. I deserved it. I was at a point at red olive where the work just wasn't interesting me. I had trouble focusing on the same kind of projects everyday. it was very strange. No hard feelings though. Red Olive is still an awesome place to work, I will always remember the people that made my day, every day. 

Anyways so now I'm open for contract work. You can [Hire Me](http://karloscarweber.com/hireme) if you'd like. I don't really want to get tied down to another agency so quickly, but bills are bills. I have a mountain load of nice ideas that I want to work on, Contract work will allow me to pay the bills __AND__ work on some awesome side projects. Look forward to exciting things in the future.

### My Plan

So my plan is to contract for the next few months, store some savings away, then Build applications for myself full time. There are certain skills that I want to learn in the next few months:

* iOS Engineering
* Ruby on Rails
* How to use Stripe
* Ember.js

The idea is that I'll be able to Design, Develop, and Market my own applications from top to bottom. I have quite a stack of ideas to work from. It's really exciting to do this on my own. 

Wish Me Luck

Sincerely,
Karl Oscar Weber
