I experienced some rather unfortunate consequences by keeping my git repository in my dropbox. I work at home, on my laptop, and at work on my desktop. Each project is maintained with git in my dropbox. Well I made the unfortunate mistake of turning dropbox off on my laptop, then making commits from my desktop. This made the files out of sync. Everything was duplicated on both computers, and I had to rebase the whole repository. 

## The Solutions

I see two possible solutions.

1. Keep my projects out of dropbox.
2. push everyday to github then pull every morning on both devices.

I think I'm going to go with number two for my own personal projects, and number one for projects I'm collaborating on. Also my work computer runs windows 7, syncing iOS projects with a windows device just doesn't make sense.
