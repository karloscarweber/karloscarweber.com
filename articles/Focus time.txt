So,

Instead of grinding straight up eight hours a day. Grind in two, three hour blocks. Or, have very focused goals, and always achieve those few goals. Focused, methodical progress. 

Iteration is a step by step process, that can't be forced. It requires time, lots of time, but the good time. The organized time. Not the hasty disorganized bad time. Cultivate this time and make certAin to iterate within it. Rest well, good food. Planning as well. Plan what you're going to do, then do it. 

Preparation + opportunity = luck. 

Make your own luck in your work.


Write Down the steps in a problem. Now, to innovate, just combine steps.

Programmers have it especially hard. During a regular day, I have to look up some obscure syntax or solution, always tempting me with some type of link bait. Resist the Link Bait</p>

<p>Organize your project into small tasks, then methodically complete them. </p>
